            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE COPIE OF A LETTER From an Vtter-Barriſter to his ſpeciall Friend, concerning Lieutenant Col. <hi>LILBVRN'S</hi> Impriſonment. <hi>Sept.</hi> 1645.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Kind Sir:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ut of the firm confidence and certain knowledge which you ſeem to have of the integrity and honeſty of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell <hi>Lilburne,</hi> and that his Letter of the 25th. of <hi>July,</hi> contains nothing but truth, I ſend you here my Senſe and Opinion concerning his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>And for the clearer explanation of what you demand, and our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtanding of one another, I conceive it neceſſary that we be at a point upon theſe two things: Firſt, what the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is: Next, for what end and purpoſe they are conveened and called together.</p>
            <p>I beleeve you agree with me, that the Houſe of Commons is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, then the repreſentative Body of the People, elected and ſent up, by the ſeverall Shires and Burroughs reſpectively <hi>(and joyned with the two other States)</hi> of capacity to make, alter, abrogate Lawes, as occaſion ſhall require; to heare and relieve the Grievances of the people, and to reforme what is amiſſe in the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Here is the Character and deſcription of the Houſe of Commons (which themſelves (I think) will allow of) and here is the end and purpoſe for which they ſerve.</p>
            <p>In this deſcription you may plainly ſee, two Bodies of the people, the repreſentative and the repreſented, which together make up the Body of the Commonwealth; and of this latter, Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Lilburne</hi> is an eminent member.</p>
            <p>Now, for any man to imagine that the ſhadow or repreſentative is more worthy then the Subſtance; or that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:180518:2"/>is more valuable and conſiderable, then the Body for whom they ſerve, is all one as if they ſhould affirme, that an Agent or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour from a <hi>Prince,</hi> hath the ſame or more authority, then the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelfe, <hi>which in matters of Proxie for Mariage, I believe no Prince will allow of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not undertake to define the limits of power or extent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, having found the practice in my reading more or leſſe, lengthned or ſhortned <hi>(like a pair of Stirrops)</hi> according to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and current of times, or the weakneſſe or power of the Prince under whom they ſerve, who hath for the moſt part ſubjected them to his will, and made them act his Deſignes.</p>
            <p>Neither will I goe about to caſt the apple of Diviſion betwixt the People and their agents, who ſhould be linkt together by common intereſt and mutuall reſpects of common preſervation; yet this much I cannot forbeare to intimate, that the one is but the ſervant of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Houſe of Commons, I meane of the People elected by them, to provide for their welfare and freedomes, againſt all inbred tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or forraign invaſion, which by reaſon of their numbers, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently doe in their owne perſons without hazard both of confuſion and deſolation.</p>
            <p>But to come to our buſineſſe, Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> complaines, that Three times ſince the firſt of <hi>May</hi> laſt, he hath been impriſoned by Authority from the Houſe of Commons, before he knew the Accuſer or Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or was ſuffered to ſpeak one word in his own defence: Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Theeves and Murtherers, taken in <hi>Flagranti delicto,</hi> in the very act of a <hi>haynous crime,</hi> are not thus hardly dealt withall.</p>
            <p>This calls to my minde the very words of a Member of the Houſe, Mr. <hi>Edward Stephens</hi> by name, uttered with paſſion openly in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter hall, in a caſe of the like injuſtice, viz. <hi>That we have not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne our ſelves from our obedience to the King, to yeeld our ſelves ſlaves and vaſſalls, to the tyranny of our fellow-ſubjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, how ſhall we amend our ſelves, we have given our ſelves, lives, liberties, and all into the Parliaments power?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That this free and abandoned confidence of ours, whereby they are intruſted with all that is dour and precious unto us, ought the rather to oblige them to a tender and conſcientious care of the diſpenſation of that power.</p>
            <p>Beſides this ſovereign or legiſlative power (which they make uſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:180518:2"/>of) is not lent them for the ruine and deſtruction of our Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties <hi>(no more then the Kings Prerogative)</hi> but for the edification and ſtrengthning of the ſame in particular, as well as generall.</p>
            <p>The abuſe and overflowing of this power, is odious to God and man; for Princes, or what State ſoever, when they arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an unlimited juriſdiction, to degenerate into Tyrants, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Hoſtes humani generis,</hi> enemies of mankinde.</p>
            <p>And the Angels (which would be like the moſt high) were by his juſt judgement changed into the moſt wretched of all creatures: It belongs to God, and to God alone, to rule the law of his bleſſed will.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Princes</hi> and States, when they breake out into exorbitancy, and will be imitators of the power of God, in governing by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumſcribed authority, they run themſelves into inevitable miſchiefs, and the people (whom they ſerve) into unavoidable inconveniencies, and this comes to paſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of neceſſity; for every State governed by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall and Arbitrary power, muſt needs be floting, inconſtant, and ſubject to change; beſides, man is naturally ambitious and apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach and uſurpe upon the liberty of his inferiours.</p>
            <p>Hence is derived that excellent maxim, <hi>Melsus ſub inquiſſima lege, quam ſub aequiſſimo arbitro vivere;</hi> It is better to live under a rigorous and unjuſt law, then an Arbitrary government though juſt, the reaſon is, becauſe by the firſt, he is at certainty, and knows what he muſt truſt too, the laſt leaves him uncertain, and ſo in danger.</p>
            <p>But to return to Lievtenant Collonel <hi>Lilburne,</hi> who ſtands impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Vote of the Houſe of Commons for refuſing to anſwer to the Committees Interrogatories, before cauſe ſhewed of his former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
            <p>I am informed by ſome Members that this Vote was obtained by <hi>Baſtwicke</hi> ſurreptitiouſly, when the Houſe was thin and empty; and therefore I conceive he may appeal from the Houſe thin and empty, to the Houſe full and compleat, if this will not be accepted of, why ſhould he not appeale to the people?</p>
            <p>For <hi>Buchanan</hi> an author without reproach in his Booke (<hi>De jure regui apud Scotos,</hi> concerning the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Laws) doth boldly and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively affirme, <hi>Supremam poteſtatem eſſe in Populo,</hi> the Supreame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be in the people.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:180518:3"/>
            <p>And before <hi>Buchanan,</hi> the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a patern and example to all ages both for Civill and Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry government) I ſay this Common-wealth in its beſt perfection did allow of this refuge or appeale to the People.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe, <hi>Titus Livius</hi> an unreproveable Author, ſpeaks in theſe termes, <hi>Decad.</hi> 5. of his Hiſtory. <hi>C. Flaminius</hi> was the firſt (as one of the firſt) that underſtanding the Majeſty of <hi>Rome</hi> to be indeed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the people, and no otherwiſe in the Senate, then by way of dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy or grand Commiſſion, did not ſtand highly upon his birth and degree, but made his addreſſe to the multitude, and taught them to know and uſe their power over himſelfe, and his fellow Senators in reforming their diſorders: For this the Commons highly eſteemed him, and the Senators as deeply hated him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I hope the Wiſdome and Providence of the Parliament will prevent theſe extremities; yet I cannot but put them in remembrance, that ſmall ſparkles do oftentimes occaſion great fires.</p>
            <p>And that the Engliſh Nation is ſenſible of nothing more then the breach of their liberties, and of violence offered to the freedome of their perſons.</p>
            <p>Witneſſe the <hi>Magna Carta</hi> thirty times confirmed by the Princes of this Hand; and witneſſe the cheerfull readineſſe of the people to ſerve the publique in this preſent great quarrrell.</p>
            <p>And let no man dreame that the Parliament may trench boldly thereon without check. A ſilly conceit, and aggravating the offence: For a dog that devoureth his owne kind, we account more unnaturall then a Lion or a Bear of another kind; beſides the heart burning which is eaſily kindled when our own fellows domineer over us.</p>
            <p>There are but two things of ruining a people, either by fear or love, the firſt may be more agreeable to Maſter <hi>Corbit,</hi> as ſutable to his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and imperious nature, or to Sir <hi>Robert Pyes</hi> Canine humour, but is brittle, and will laſt no longer then the fom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which ſupports it. The ſecond, of love, is ſafe and durable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camillus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> ſpeaks of it in two words, <hi>Firmiſſimum imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um quo obedientes gaudent,</hi> the moſt ſtable laſting government under which the people rejoyce and live cheerfully.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lilburnes</hi> caſe is ſingular, that a member of the body repreſented, a free born ſubject, in life and converſation without exception. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:180518:3"/>both in his actions and ſuffrings in this great cauſe, that ſuch a ſubject contrary to the tenor of <hi>Magna Carta,</hi> contrary to the late Covenant and Petition of Right, yea and the direct rule alleadged in Scripture, ſhould be three times impriſoned without ſhewing cauſe by a Parliament profeſſing Reformation, and defence of our Lawes and Liberties, and without any urgent or apparent neceſſity of State enforcing it.</p>
            <p>This I profeſſe is to me a riddle beyond all that this monſtrous age hath brought forth; I need not ſay how much the publicke liberty is wounded in the injury doubled and trebled upon their fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor the conſequences therof, which if drawn into preſident, who can count himſelfe free? Nor the conſequences of a wicked ſentence (which as Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaies) is infinitely worſe then a wicked fact, as being held a preſident or paterne, whereby oppreſſion begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon one, is extended as warrantable upon all.</p>
            <p>And this concluſion he draweth out of this place of Scripture, <hi>Font turbatus pede et vena corrupta, eſt juſtus cadens coram impio.</hi> A juſt man falling into the hands of the wicked, is like a fountaine troubled with the foot, or the urines corrupted in the body.</p>
            <p>The horror of this ſentence hath ſtricken the generality of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with amazement, to behold the Kid ſeething in the milke of the Damme, that is to ſay, the Chambers of Juſtice ordained for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, preſervation, and ſafety, unkindly wreſted to enſlave, ruine, and deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>Surely after ages when they ſhall ponder theſe proceedings in cold and ſober bloud, will be aſhamed to own the actors for their parents or predeceſſors: And it is to be feared that the ſtones from the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will riſe in judgement one day againſt the abuſers of the truſt committed unto them.</p>
            <p>And let no man deceive himſelfe, to thinke with ſenſeleſſe and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous diſtinctions to award the diſhonor and danger, which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to the Parliament hence; as to ſay that the Great Charter is but ſuſpended as to <hi>Lilburne,</hi> but not abrogated; and that the duty of the Parliament is to provide for generalities, but is not at leyſure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend particular greevances: theſe anſwers ſatisfie none but Ideots, or thoſe that ſuck profit under their command.</p>
            <p>I mentioned before the danger and diſhonour ariſing to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:180518:4"/>hereby, which of neceſſity muſt enſue; for ſeeing that <hi>Omne Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perium in conſenſu &amp; aſſenſu parentium fondatur Plinius, Paneg.</hi> All law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Empire or Soveraigne command hath its baſis or firm foundation in the conſent, approbation and good liking of the people; a rule without exception.</p>
            <p>What conſent or good liking can be expected from thoſe who daily ſee themſelves abuſed in their liberties, and ruined in their Eſtates? Nay, what hope of redreſſe, when as our Petitions will not be accepted without great friends in the Houſe? To be ſhort, it is not credible that either people or perſon, in any outward condition under which they mourne, ſigh, or groan, will continue any longer therein, then they have occaſion of good termes to be delivered, according to the ſaying of <hi>Liv. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Non credible eſt illum Populum, vel hominem denique, in eâ conditione, cujus cum poeniteat, diutius quam neceſſe ſit manſurum.</hi> Hence it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the multitude toucht to the quick in their liberties and means of living, will be eaſily perſwaded to ſhake off all Bonds of obedience, ſo neceſſary to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and to caſt the blame of their ſufferings upon the Authors, either as falſe to their Truſt, <hi>uncapable of the great weight of</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity committed unto them: For who but a mad man will yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto thoſe, who are regardleſſe of their Laws and Liberties, or negligent of the means of their Subſiſtance, Livelihood, and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? the maine and only ends for which they are conveened and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together; and not to provide Offices for themſelves, or to ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Cauſes of their particular friends, ſometimes the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the State.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, paſſe not lightly by theſe Conſiderations as idle and vaine feares; for who ſhall hinder the multitude, if ſtung with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſe of their loſt Freedomes, and means of ſubſiſting; they ſhall endeavour the re-gaining thereof by ſome ſudden attempt, ſeeing that (if the worſt happen) they cannot be in much worſe condition then they now are: As to the Committee for Examinations (menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Mr. <hi>Lilburns</hi> Letter) which ought to be the Touchſtone, whereby to diſcern Gold from counterfeit: And in equity and reaſon ought to be free, equall, and open as well to the Plantiffe, as Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, eſpecially in Criminall Cauſes: But in caſes of Treaſon, or which concern the Publique ſafety, ought rather to lend an attentive
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:180518:4"/>care to the <hi>Delators</hi> or <hi>Accuſers,</hi> then any way to diſcourage them: For if theſe neceſſary evils ſhall be diſheartned, who will watch over the ſafety of the State? Beſides, it is more ſafe and tollerable in the condition wherein we now are, that a miſchief ſhould happen to one man, then a ruine to a whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>As to this Committee, I wiſh from my ſoule, that Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell LILBURNE were the only complainant againſt them: Let <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> the <hi>Exchange,</hi> and other places of publique mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, inform you; What making of ſides, browbeating of witneſſes, baffeling of evidences, facing, and out-facing of the truth? What impertinent diſtinguiſhing and abuſing the formalities of the Law, is there complained of? And all this noiſe and turmoil to helpe a knave out of the briers.</p>
            <p>It were more for the honour of their juſtice, and the ſatisfaction of the people, if the uſuall forms of proceeding in caſes of charge of Treaſon were obſerved: That is, that the perſon accuſed, were ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and the accuſers heard with all equanimity, patience and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Whereas on the contrary, the accuſed is permitted to ſit down covered, as Peer and companion with the Commiſſioners, and to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne his accuſers.</p>
            <p>O wretched times! O miſerable <hi>England!</hi> which doſt labour with all the ſymptomes, marks, and tokens, of a declining and dying ſtate! Injuſtice avowed; Treaſon countenanced; Oppreſſion, become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, almoſt legall; Oaths, Proteſtations, and Covenants ſolemnly made in the <hi>preſence of God</hi> and man, ſlighted, and ſet at nought: Then to fill up the meaſure of our ſorrowes, a Civill War within our owne bowels, nay almoſt in every family: And laſt of all, a generall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of manners, which aſſures us the malady will be laſting, if not incurable: What will be the end and iſſue of all this? Seek to that Oracle which cannot lie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Propter injuſtitiam, &amp; injurias, &amp; contumelias &amp; diverſos dolos: Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num agente in gentem transfertur, Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> Chap. 10. verſe 8. <hi>Becauſe of unrighteous dealings, injuries and riches got by deceit, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is tranſlated from one people to another.</hi>
